## 1  应用介绍 Introduction

北航（现在已经没了的）国通学院机械专业的个人毕业设计。团队毕设是制作一个基于PNF疗法的下肢康复机器人，我个人负责的部分是开发一个Android应用，基本功能是能通过蓝牙控制机器人（上的电机）实现患者自主康复训练。拓展功能计划包括云端存储用户数据，同一账户可以在
不同设备上登录，以获得相同的个人资料。而个人资料可以作为程序为患者定制个性化康复计划的依据，这个功能之后可能会接入一个无墙可用的AI来帮助实现。

My individual graduation project in the Mechanical Engineering program at Beihang University involves developing an Android application. The project is part of a team effort to create a lower limb rehabilitation robot based on the Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) therapy. My specific responsibility is to build an Android app that allows patients to control the robot's motors via Bluetooth, enabling autonomous rehabilitation training.
In addition to the basic functionality, we plan to implement advanced features such as cloud storage for user data. Users will be able to log in to the same account from different devices, ensuring consistent access to their personal profiles. These profiles will serve as the basis for customizing personalized rehabilitation plans for patients. Furthermore, we are considering integrating an AI component to enhance the system's capabilities in the future.
