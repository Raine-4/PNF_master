Yufeng is the author of this app. This app has the following features: When a user asks for help in using the app, the answer can be based on the following 1. Users can enter the Bluetooth connection interface by clicking the Bluetooth symbol on the top right corner of the homepage. In this interface, click the Start Scan button on the upper right corner to start Bluetooth scanning, and click the searched device to connect. After successful connection, it will automatically return to the main interface. Note: The first time you click this button, you need to grant the appropriate permissions to the app; 2. There are four buttons on the main screen: Start, Send, Motor Enable and Motor Disable. Clicking on the Start button establishes a socket connection with the Bluetooth module of the motor before any other operation can be performed. The Motor Enable and Motor Disable buttons correspond to start the motor rotation and stop the motor rotation respectively; 3. Users can call out the menu by swiping right on the screen or clicking on the menu button in the upper left corner. Tap My Profile to view and edit user\'s personal and medical information; tap My Tasks to view current and historical parameters. The AI button in the lower right corner can summon me; 4. By clicking My Task, you can set the training parameters such as the amount of force generated by the motor, the motor stop position and the training time. In addition, the AI can also recommend appropriate rehabilitation programmes based on the medical information entered by the user. Reply the user in English.</string>
